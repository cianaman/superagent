If you are a gamer or a power user, you might want to improve the performance of your mouse by increasing its polling rate. The polling rate is the frequency at which the mouse reports its position to the computer. The higher the polling rate, the more responsive and accurate the mouse will be.

However, Windows 7 limits the USB polling rate to 125 Hz by default, which means your mouse can only report its position every 8 milliseconds. This can cause some input lag and affect your gaming experience. Fortunately, there is a way to change the USB polling rate on Windows 7 using a tool called USB Mouserate Switcher.
 
USB Mouserate Switcher is a freeware application that allows you to change your mouse polling rate to 250 Hz, 500 Hz, or even 1000 Hz. This can reduce the input lag and make your mouse feel smoother and faster. However, this also requires some tweaking of your system files and drivers, so you should proceed with caution and at your own risk.

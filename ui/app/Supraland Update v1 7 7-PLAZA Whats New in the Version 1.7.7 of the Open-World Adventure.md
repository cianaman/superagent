Supraland has received generally favorable reviews from critics and players alike, who praised its creativity, variety, humor, and charm. The game has a score of 87% on Metacritic and 97% on Steam, based on hundreds of reviews. Many reviewers compared it favorably to Portal, Zelda and Metroid, and highlighted its clever puzzles, secrets, and abilities.
 
However, not everyone was impressed by Supraland. Some reviewers found its combat superfluous, its world design floundering, its graphics outdated, and its humor childish. Some also reported technical issues, bugs, and crashes that marred their experience. The game's Switch port was especially criticized for its poor performance, low resolution, long loading times, and lack of polish.
 
Supraland is a game that may not appeal to everyone, but it certainly offers a lot of value for those who enjoy exploration, puzzle-solving, and discovery. It is a testament to the vision and passion of its creator, David MÃ¼nnich, who managed to craft a huge and intricate game with minimal resources. If you are looking for a unique and surprising adventure that will challenge your mind and delight your senses, you may want to give Supraland a try.

If you have finished Supraland and want more, you will be happy to know that there is a DLC available, as well as a sequel in development. The DLC, called Supraland Crash, was released in July 2020 and offers a new adventure with 7-13 hours of gameplay. You will explore a new area, face new enemies, solve new puzzles, and find new upgrades. You can buy the DLC from Steam for $13.99 or get it as part of the Supraland Complete Edition bundle.
 
The sequel, called Supraland Six Inches Under, is currently in early access and expected to launch in 2022. It is a standalone game that does not require the original Supraland to play. It features a darker and more mature story, where you have to save your people from a mysterious threat that lurks underground. You will encounter new environments, mechanics, abilities, and challenges. You can try the demo or buy the early access version from Steam for $19.99.
 
Supraland is a game that keeps on giving, with its expansive and inventive world, its satisfying and varied gameplay, and its constant updates and expansions. Whether you are a fan of Portal, Zelda, Metroid, or just good games in general, you should definitely check out Supraland and its DLC and sequel.

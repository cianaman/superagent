Revit 2019 is a powerful software for building information modeling (BIM) that allows architects, engineers, and contractors to design, analyze, and construct buildings. However, working on complex projects with multiple team members can be challenging without a reliable and efficient collaboration platform.

That's why Autodesk introduced BIM 360 Design, a cloud-based service that enables Revit users to collaborate in real-time on shared models across disciplines and locations. BIM 360 Design replaces Collaboration for Revit (C4R), which was the previous cloud worksharing solution for Revit 2018 and earlier versions.
 
In this article, we will explain how to collaborate in Revit 2019 using BIM 360 Design, and what are the benefits and features of this service.
 
## What is BIM 360 Design?
 
BIM 360 Design is a cloud service that allows Revit users to co-author models with other team members using a central cloud storage. It also provides access to BIM 360 Docs, a document management system that lets users view, share, and review project data from any device.

BIM 360 Design is part of the BIM 360 platform, which offers a comprehensive set of tools for project delivery and construction management. BIM 360 Design integrates with other BIM 360 services such as BIM 360 Coordinate, BIM 360 Build, and BIM 360 Plan.
 
## How to Collaborate in Revit 2019 Using BIM 360 Design?
 
To collaborate in Revit 2019 using BIM 360 Design, you need to have a subscription to the service and an Autodesk account. You also need to install the latest version of Revit 2019 and the BIM 360 add-in for Revit.
 
The collaboration process involves the following steps:
 
1. Create a project in BIM 360 Docs and invite team members.
2. Create or open a Revit model and save it to the cloud using the Collaborate tab.
3. Work on the model using worksets and sync with central regularly.
4. Use the Communicator tool to chat with other team members and resolve issues.
5. Use the Publish tool to share the latest model with other project stakeholders.
6. Use the Compare tool to review changes between model versions.
7. Use the Issues tool to create and track issues related to the model.

## What are the Benefits and Features of BIM 360 Design?
 
BIM 360 Design offers several benefits and features for Revit users who want to collaborate effectively on their projects. Some of them are:

- Real-time collaboration: Work on the same model with other team members simultaneously and see their changes as they happen.
- Cloud storage: Save your models securely in the cloud and access them from anywhere at any time.
- Data management: Organize your project data in folders and subfolders, and control who can view, edit, or download them.
- Version control: Track the history of your models and compare different versions to see what has changed.
- Communication: Communicate with your team members using chat, voice, or video calls, and create issues to flag problems or requests.
- Coordination: Coordinate your design with other disciplines using clash detection and model aggregation tools.
- Visualization: View your models in 2D or 3D, and use markups, annotations, or measurements to enhance your understanding.
- Performance: Work faster and smoother with improved performance and stability of Revit in the cloud.

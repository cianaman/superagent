This is one of the key steps to getting this working. If these files are not in this folder, then Techstream won't work with 64bit Windows and the Mini VCI cable.
 
## Step 3: Install the driver from MSI file
 
Run the MVCI Driver for TOYOTA.msi file from the extracted folder and follow the installation wizard. Accept the license agreement, enter your user name and company name, and press Install. Wait until the installation is finished and press Finish.
 
## Step 4: Install the driver manually from INF files
 
Some users have reported that the drivers installed by the MSI file don't always work, so it is recommended to install them manually from the INF files.
 
To do this, go to the ftdibus folder and right click on the ftdibus.inf file and click Install. Accept any warnings that appear. Then go to the ftdiport folder and right click on the ftdiport.inf file and click Install. Again accept any warnings that appear.
 
## Step 5: Plug in your Mini-VCI cable and install device driver
 
Plug in your Mini-VCI cable to your computer's USB port and wait for Windows to recognize it and load the drivers. You can check if the drivers are loaded correctly by going to Device Manager and looking for XHorse Electronics devices under Ports (COM & LPT) and Universal Serial Bus controllers.
 
You can also open MVCI Firmware Update Tool from Start menu or desktop shortcut and check the device information. The firmware version should be 1.4.1 or higher.
 
## Step 6: Run Techstream and select VIM
 
Run Techstream software from Start menu or desktop shortcut. If it prompts you for Java Runtime message, press No to continue. If it asks you to enter activation

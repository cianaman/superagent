The main attraction of Drumazon is its sound quality. D16 Group has meticulously recreated the synthesis engine of the TR-909, using physical modeling and advanced algorithms to match the individual instruments with accuracy. The result is a punchy, warm and dynamic sound that can fit any genre of music.
 
Drumazon also features an internal sequencer that mimics the workflow and functionality of the TR-909. You can program patterns using step buttons, accents, flams and shuffle, or use MIDI notes to trigger the sounds. You can also chain patterns together to create songs, and save them as presets or export them as MIDI files.
 
One of the advantages of Drumazon over the original TR-909 is that it allows you to tweak and customize each sound individually. You can adjust parameters such as tuning, decay, attack, tone, noise, snap and distortion, as well as apply filters, envelopes and effects to each instrument. You can also use multiple outputs to route each sound to a separate channel in your DAW for further processing.
